Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category ===== Type checking may occur either at compile-time (static checking) or at run-time(dynamic checking). A programming language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. Here, the data type is fixed to avoid errors which means, the programmer must specify what the data type of each variable is. Examples of statically typed programming languages include; Java, C, C++, C#, Swift and Kotlin. A language is dynamically typed if the type of a variable is checked during run-time. The programmer must specify what the data type of each variable while writing code. Examples of dynamically typed programming languages include; Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Objective-C.

Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined' ===== Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing. Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined / assigned.
